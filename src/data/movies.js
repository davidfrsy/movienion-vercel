    review:
      "Inception is not just a film; it is a cerebral heist that unfolds within the architecture of the mind. Christopher Nolan masterfully crafts a narrative that is as intricate as it is thrilling, demanding the audience's full attention. The concept of shared dreaming is explored with such visual panache and intellectual rigor that it leaves a lasting impression. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Cobb is both haunted and determined, leading a stellar cast through layers of subconsciousness. The film's practical effects, combined with its profound questions about reality and memory, elevate it from a simple blockbuster to a modern classic. Every viewing reveals new details, making it one of the most rewatchable and discussed films of the 21st century.",

    review:
      "The Dark Knight transcends the superhero genre to become a gripping crime saga. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic, an agent of chaos whose motivations are as terrifying as they are enigmatic. The film explores complex themes of order, chaos, heroism, and sacrifice. Christian Bale's Batman is pushed to his absolute limits, questioning the very rules he lives by. The practical action sequences, particularly the armored car chase, are visceral and brilliantly executed. It remains a benchmark for comic book adaptations, proving they can be both entertaining and philosophically profound.",
